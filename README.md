# FizzBuzz
Thinkful Challenge App: FizzBuzz

* Original Project Requirements *

In this assignment, you'll build a FizzBuzz app from scratch. In the original game of Fizz Buzz, you count from 1 to a given number (let's say 100). For each number if it's not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. If it's divisible by 3, instead of the number you say "fizz". If it's divisible by 5, you say "buzz". And finally if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "fizz buzz". So, counting from 1 to 15, you'd say: "1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizz buzz".

DO NOT spend any time designing this app or making it look pretty. We don't want you to consider UX at all here, since the point is to build up your programming fundamentals.
At a minimum, you'll need an HTML file and a JavaScript file. The HTML file should link to jQuery and to your application JavaScript file. The program should append each number (or its "fizz"/"buzz"/"fizzbuzz" substitution) to the body element of the DOM (On the page).
The program should print out each number (not 'one' for 1, but 1 for 1), from 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "fizz buzz", those divisible by 3 with "fizz", and those divisible by 5 with "buzz".
You should use GitHub for this project, and when it's done, publish it with GitHub pages.


* Refactor Project *

Earlier in this unit you built a FizzBuzz app. As per our instructions, your app was required to list out the numbers from 1 to 100, using the FizzBuzz rules for substituting in multiples of 3, 5 and both 3 and 5 (a.k.a. 15). For this assignment, take your original FizzBuzz app and refactor it so it uses a function and meets the following requirements:

When the page loads, the user should be prompted to supply a number.
You'll need to write one named function that takes an integer as argument, and then counts from 1 to the argument value, substituting "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz" accordingly.
You'll need to convert the value the user supplies from a string to a number.
You will need to validate user input to ensure the user is submitting a number.
DO NOT spend any time thinking about design for this app. Like the first version, the goal here is not to create a pretty app, but instead to hone your JavaScript skills.
As usual, use Git to store your changes. When you've completed this assignment, push it up to GitHub pages.
